Descripion:
Monumental Pain draws inspiration from the unique abandoned style of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link and expresses thematic elements through it. In the game, a magical advisor to the land’s government believes that the monuments are oppressive landmarks of the past and gathers a following; meanwhile, the player plays as a hero who must travel to different parts of the world to protect these monuments. The player progresses between stages via an overworld. The game evokes a sense of impending doom where propaganda throughout the world undermine the player’s effort, not every monument can be saved, and a game over results in a screen depicting a silhouette of the game’s antagonist. The only hope left to the player lies in the citizens of the world they may inspire.
